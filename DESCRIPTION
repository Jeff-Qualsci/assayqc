Description: Statistical tools to validate in vitro bioassay performance and 
    document reproducibility over time for both efficacy and potency result 
    types. The statistical analyses are based upon the recommendations from the
    NIH Assay Guidance Manual. You provide the data, specify type of result the
    assay produces, and select the analysis. These tools will generate the
    summary statistics and data plots.
